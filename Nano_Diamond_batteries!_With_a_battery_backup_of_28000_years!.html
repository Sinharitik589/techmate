Imagine the day when you are ordering online a <b>new Phone for your battery </b>instead of new battery. It will be of great fun right.<br/><br/>Nano diamond batteries, the technology that uses the diamond batteries concept or the nuclear battery concept. It is proposed to give 28000 years of battery backup.<br/><br/>The concept of "DIAMOND BATTERIES "proposed by the University of Bristol Cabot Institute during their annual lecture held on 25 November 2016 at the Wills Memorial Building.<br/> Theoretically it was said that , the battery will run on the radioactive waste of graphite blocks and will be able to deliver constant small current for thousands of years. It is named as diamond batteries, because it will use CARBON 14 , in the form of DIAMOND like carbon (DLC).<br/><br/>Since this claim, a lot of prototypes were proposed but none of them tried to put them in Market. <br/>But now a startup named <b>NANO DIAMOND BATTERIES [NDB] Inc. </b> claimed that they are going to make these batteries available commercially.<br/>That means, people will be able to use them in their cars or smartphones etc.</p><div class="subheading"><h3><U>PROPOSED APPLICATIONS </U></h3><div class="subheading-image"></div><p></p><div class="pro-con"></div><div class="pro-con"></div><div class="pro-con"></div><div class="row"></div></div><div class="subheading"><h3>Smartphone Will not require Charging anymore</h3><div class="subheading-image"><img alt="Smartphone Will not require Charging anymore" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.dignited.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/why-your-phone-charges-slow.jpg?resize=768%2C438&amp;ssl=1"/></div><p>Yes You heard it right, If NDB is able to make this battery available for comercial use.
